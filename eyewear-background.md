Eyewear Industry Background Knowledge
1. How does the business work?
1.1 How to get prescription eyewear as a offline customer :
    1. Schedule an Eye Exam:
       - If you're experiencing vision problems or it's been a while since your last check-up, book an appointment with an optometrist or ophthalmologist for a comprehensive eye exam.
    
    2. During the Eye Exam:
       - The eye doctor will perform various tests to determine the health of your eyes and whether you need corrective lenses.
       - Once the exam is complete, the doctor will provide you with a prescription if needed. This prescription contains specific details about the lenses you require.
    
    3. Understanding Your Insurance:
       - If you have vision insurance, check the coverage details. Some insurance plans cover the eye exam, a portion of the cost of the glasses, or both.
       - Understand the terms of your coverage, such as approved providers, frame and lens allowances, and the frequency of coverage (e.g., one pair of glasses every year).
    
    4. Choosing a Provider:
       - Based on your insurance coverage, select an optical store or online retailer that accepts your insurance.
       - If you're not restricted to specific providers, you can choose any retailer.
    
    5. Selecting Frames & Lenses:
       - Browse through frames that suit your style and face shape.
       - Discuss lens options with the optician, considering features like anti-reflective coating, blue light protection, or transition lenses.
       - Ensure the frames and lenses you choose are within the allowance of your insurance plan if applicable.
    
    6. Ordering the Glasses:
       - Provide the optician or online retailer with your prescription.
       - If purchasing in-store, the optician will measure your pupillary distance (PD) to ensure the lenses align correctly with your eyes. Some online retailers provide tools to measure this yourself.
    
    7. Claiming Insurance:
       - In-network Providers: If the optical store is within your insurance network, they might directly bill the insurance company. You'll only need to pay any out-of-pocket costs not covered by your plan.
       - Out-of-network Providers: If the optical store isn't in your insurance network, you'll pay the full amount upfront. Then, you'll need to submit a claim to your insurance company for reimbursement. Ensure you keep all receipts and get a detailed invoice from the provider.
    
    8. Receiving the Glasses:
       - In-store purchases usually take about a week or two for the glasses to be ready. The store will notify you once they're available.
       - For online purchases, the delivery time can vary based on the retailer and shipping options.
    
    9. Adjustments & Fitting:
       - When you collect your glasses, the optician will adjust the frames for a proper fit.
       - Wear your glasses consistently to get used to them. Some people might experience discomfort or dizziness initially, but this usually subsides after a few days. If not, consult the optician or your eye doctor.
    
    10. Care for Your Eyewear:
       - Store them in a case when not in use.
       - Clean the lenses with a microfiber cloth.
       - Avoid placing them lens-down on surfaces.
    
    11. Follow-up:   
    - Some optometrists recommend a follow-up visit to ensure the prescription is correct and the glasses are comfortable.
1.2 How to prepare prescription eyewear for a customer as eyewear store owner:
    1. Customer Consultation:
       - Begin with a thorough consultation to understand the customer's needs and preferences.
       - Review the prescription provided by the customer. Ensure it's recent (typically within the last 1-2 years).
    
    2. Frame Selection:
       - Assist the customer in selecting a frame that suits their face shape, style preferences, and the type of lenses they need (single vision, bifocal, progressive).
       - Ensure the frame is suitable for the lens prescription, especially if the customer has a high prescription which might require thicker lenses.
    
    3. Lens Selection:
       - Discuss lens materials (plastic, polycarbonate, high-index, etc.) and recommend one based on the prescription and customer's activities.
       - Offer additional lens features like anti-reflective coating, blue light protection, UV protection, photochromic lenses, etc., and explain their benefits.
    
    4. Taking Measurements:
       - Measure the Pupillary Distance (PD) â€“ the distance between the centers of the pupils in both eyes.
       - For bifocal or progressive lenses, mark the height at which the reading portion should begin.
    
    5. Ordering the Lenses:
       - If you don't have an in-house lab, order the correct lenses from a trusted supplier or laboratory, specifying the prescription, material, and any additional features.
    
    6. Lens Cutting and Fitting:
       - Once the lenses arrive, use a lens edger to cut them to fit the chosen frame. This step requires precision to ensure the lenses fit snugly and are aligned correctly with the frame.
       - Fit the lenses into the frame. Ensure there are no rough or protruding edges.
    
    7. Quality Check:
       - Inspect the glasses for any defects or imperfections.
       - Ensure the lenses match the prescription using a lensometer, an instrument that verifies the prescription of eyeglasses.
       - Check the alignment and ensure the frame sits well without any imbalances.
    
    8. Adjustments:
       - When the customer comes to pick up the eyewear, make any necessary adjustments to the frame to ensure a comfortable fit. Adjust the temples, nose pads, and frame front as needed.
       
    9. Educate the Customer:
       - Provide care instructions, such as how to clean the lenses, how to store the glasses, and what to avoid (e.g., leaving them in a hot car).
       - Inform the customer about the adjustment period, especially if it's their first time wearing glasses or if they've switched to a new type of lens.
    
    10. Provide a Warranty and Return Policy:
       - Inform the customer about any warranties on the frame and lenses. Also, clarify the return or exchange policy in case the customer faces issues with the eyewear.
    
    11. Follow-up:
       - Consider reaching out to the customer after a week or two to ensure they're comfortable with their new glasses and to address any concerns.
    
    12. Maintain Records:
       - Keep detailed records of each customer's purchases, prescriptions, and preferences. This not only aids in any future purchases but also ensures you can provide replacements or repairs as needed.

3. What's a prescription looks like? How to read it?
  
  1. OD: This stands for "Oculus Dexter" and refers to the right eye.
  2. OS: This stands for "Oculus Sinister" and refers to the left eye.
  For both OD and OS:
  1. SPH (Sphere): This indicates the power of the lens required to correct nearsightedness or farsightedness. A negative value (-) indicates a prescription for nearsightedness (myopia), while a positive value (+) is for farsightedness (hyperopia).
  2. CYL (Cylinder): This indicates the power for astigmatism correction. Like the sphere, it can be negative or positive. If there's no astigmatism, this section might be blank or have "DS" (diopters sphere) written.
  3. AXIS: If there's a cylinder value, there will be an axis value. It represents the orientation of the astigmatism, measured in degrees from 0 to 180.
  4. ADD: This is the added magnifying power applied to the bottom part of multifocal lenses to correct presbyopia. It's usually a positive number and can be the same for both eyes.
  5. PD (Pupillary Distance): This is the distance between the centers of the pupils in each eye, measured in millimeters. It helps position the optical center of the lens directly in front of the pupil. Sometimes it's given as two values, one for each eye, from the center of the nose to the pupil (e.g., 32/31).
  6. Prism: This is not as common but may be prescribed to correct eye alignment issues. It's measured in prism diopters.
  7. Base: If there's a prism value, there will also be a base indicating the direction of the prism (e.g., Up, Down, In, Out).
  8. NV (Near Vision) or DV (Distance Vision): Sometimes, a prescription might have these notations indicating the use of the lenses, whether for reading up close (NV) or for seeing at a distance (DV).
